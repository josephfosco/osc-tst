To start the supercollider server use
scsynth -u 57711

this starts supercollider with the udp port 57711
udp port 57711 seems to be default ued for supercollider

Look into what the file that SC lang uses to store synthdefs looks like

Rename the osc directory to osc-sc and move it to the same level as osc-clj and src.
Convert all references to it and set it up as a OSC Supercolider lib

Remove the extra functions added to the cop of connections - find where these functions
are located in some helper function

Fix license - add mit license to Overtone code and osc-clj
