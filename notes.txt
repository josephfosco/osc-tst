Look into what the file that SC lang uses to store synthdefs looks like

Rename the osc directory to osc-sc and move it to the same level as osc-clj and src.
Convert all references to it and set it up as a OSC Supercolider lib

Remove the extra functions added to the cop of connections - find where these functions
are located in some helper function
