;; Pattern-matched retrievel of handlers. Implements the following pattern
;; matching rules from the Open Sound Control Spec 1.0:
;; http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0
;;
;; When an OSC server receives an OSC Message, it must invoke the appropriate OSC
;; Methods in its OSC Address Space based on the OSC Message's OSC Address
;; Pattern. This process is called dispatching the OSC Message to the OSC Methods
;; that match its OSC Address Pattern. All the matching OSC Methods are invoked
;; with the same argument data, namely, the OSC Arguments in the OSC Message.
;;
;; The parts of an OSC Address or an OSC Address Pattern are the substrings
;; between adjacent pairs of forward slash characters and the substring after the
;; last forward slash character.
;;
;; A received OSC Message must be disptched to every OSC method in the current
;; OSC Address Space whose OSC Address matches the OSC Message's OSC Address
;; Pattern. An OSC Address Pattern matches an OSC Address if:
;;
;; 1. The OSC Address and the OSC Address Pattern contain the same number of
;;    parts; and
;; 2. Each part of the OSC Address Pattern matches the corresponding part of the
;;    OSC Address.
;;
;; A part of an OSC Address Pattern matches a part of an OSC Address if every
;; consecutive character in the OSC Address Pattern matches the next consecutive
;; substring of the OSC Address and every character in the OSC Address is matched
;; by something in the OSC Address Pattern. These are the matching rules for
;; characters in the OSC Address Pattern:
;;
;; 1. '?' in the OSC Address Pattern matches any single character
;; 2. '*' in the OSC Address Pattern matches any sequence of zero or more characters
;; 3. A string of characters in square brackets (e.g., \"[string]\") in the OSC
;;    Address Pattern matches any character in the string. Inside square
;;    brackets, the minus sign (-) and exclamation point (!) have special meanings:
;;      * two characters separated by a minus sign indicate the range of
;;        characters between the given two in ASCII collating sequence. (A minus
;;        sign at the end of the string has no special meaning.)
;;      * An exclamation point at the beginning of a bracketed string negates the
;;        sense of the list, meaning that the list matches any character not in
;;        the list. (An exclamation point anywhere besides the first character
;;        after the open bracket has no special meaning.)
;; 4. A comma-separated list of strings enclosed in curly braces (e.g.,
;;    \"{foo,bar}\") in the OSC Address Pattern matches any of the strings in the
;;    list.
;; 5. Any other character in an OSC Address Pattern can match only the same
;;    character.
